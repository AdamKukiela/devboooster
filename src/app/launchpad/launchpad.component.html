          Launchpads allow experienced Software Engineers to educate Junior
          Developers and reap the rewards of that commitment. Launchpads are set
          up as an on-site office that is run by the mentor as a side gig to
          their day job.

        <h1>Mentors</h1>

        <span>
          Mentors' mission is to first spend months educating the mentees - so
          that they're not junior anymore - and then subcontracting them on
          predefined rates. Once hired, mentees get additional support.

          Mentees are committing to two- year-long Loyalty Agreements as a form
          of appreciation for free education, and mentors keep growing with
          their Launchpad - what hinders their need for looking for other
          opportunities.
